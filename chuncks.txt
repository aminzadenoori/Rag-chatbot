Hiring Committee
Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials
University of Groningen
Groningen, Netherlands
Dear Hiring Committee,
I am writing to express my interest in the postdoctoral researcher position focused on high-efficiency



wide-bandgap perovskite for perovskite-perovskite tandem solar cells at the University of Groningen.
With a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering, specializing in Machine Learning from the Università degli
Studi di Firenze, and extensive experience in numerical modeling, machine learning, and data
analysis, I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to your cutting-edge research.
During my tenure as a Postdoctoral Researcher at Università di Pisa, I led multiple projects that



utilized machine learning techniques to solve complex problems across different sectors. One
notable project involved predictive maintenance for bus fleets, where I applied advanced analytics
and machine learning models using TensorFlow and PyTorch. This project significantly improvedoperational efficiency and reduced downtime, demonstrating my ability to develop and implement
innovative solutions in a collaborative environment.



In my previous role as a Machine Learning Researcher at STLAB, I developed predictive models to
enhance patient care and optimize healthcare operations. My work required a deep understanding
of machine learning algorithms and the ability to translate complex data into actionable insights. This
experience honed my skills in data analysis, numerical modeling, and the use of advanced tools
such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.



such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
My doctoral research focused on applying machine learning techniques to stochastic modeling of
systems, supervised by experts in the field. This project required the development and enhancement
of algorithms and models for systems characterized by randomness and uncertainty, aligning closely
with the research objectives of the Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials.
I am proficient in Python, R, and various machine learning frameworks, and I have a strong track



record of developing and deploying machine learning models. My ability to work effectively in
interdisciplinary teams and communicate complex results to both scientific peers and broader
audiences would be a valuable asset to your research group.
The opportunity to work on high-efficiency perovskite solar cells in collaboration with leading
European academic and industrial partners is particularly exciting. I am confident that my



background in machine learning, numerical modeling, and collaborative research will enable me to
make significant contributions to your team.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills
and experiences align with the goals of the Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials.Sincerely,
Amin Zadenoori, Ph.D.
