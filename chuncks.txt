Experience
Computer Vision Engineer (Freelancer)
Sodi Scientifica Srl
Nov 2022 - May 2023 (7 months)
As a Computer Vision Engineer Freelancer at Sodi Scientifica, my role revolves around harnessing



cutting-edge technologies to enhance roadway safety through advanced traffic monitoring systems.
Leveraging 3D point clouds captured by LIDAR technology, our team develops robust algorithms for
the classification and tracking of vehicles on highways. By meticulously analyzing the intricate details
of these point clouds, we discern distinct object features and trajectories, enabling precise identification
and tracking of vehicles in real-time. This intricate process forms the backbone of our speed detection



system, allowing for accurate measurement of vehicle velocities on the highway. Through our efforts,
we aim to contribute significantly to the improvement of road safety and traffic management strategies.
Machine Learning Engineer

Jul 2022 - Present (1 year 9 months)
During my tenure as a Machine Learning Engineer at MAIOR, a prominent Italian company specializing



in software solutions, I led two significant projects, each leveraging machine learning techniques to
address distinct challenges in different sectors.
Project 1: Modelling Unoperated Trips in Transportation
Focus: Analyzed historical data to model unoperated trips, aiming to enhance planning for local
transport firms and airlines.
Tools: Utilized Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch during development.
Outcome: Developed and deployed a Flask web application, optimizing operational processes for



transportation firms.
Project 2: Predictive Maintenance for Bus Fleets
Role: Data Scientist and AI Developer
Focus: Developed a predictive maintenance system for bus fleets, leveraging advanced analytics and
machine learning models.
Tools: Utilized TensorFlow, PyTorch, and GPT API for predictive analytics and fault diagnosis.
Outcome: Significantly enhanced fleet reliability and operational efficiency, leading to reduced downtime
and maintenance costs.



and maintenance costs.
Project 3: Design and Implementation of the "RAG driven chat bot" System
Focus: Spearheaded the development of the "Talk to PDF" project, a sophisticated system designed to
extract, analyze, and interpret information from PDF documents through natural language queries.
Tools and Technologies: The project leveraged a combination of open-source tools and advanced
machine learning models, including Python for backend development, Streamlit for the web interface,



PyPDF2 for PDF text extraction, and LangChain for text processing and embeddings. A pivotal part
of the system was the integration of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3,
BERT, and T5 from the Hugging Face library.
Research Assistant
STLAB (Software Technologies LAB)
Feb 2022 - Jul 2022 (6 months)
Machine Learning Researcher
Università degli Studi di Firenze
Nov 2018 - Jan 2022 (3 years 3 months)



I was a PhD candidate in machine learning, supervised by Paolo Frasconi and Enrico Vicario,
working on a project that focused on applying machine learning techniques to stochastic modeling of
systems. As a member of this research team, my main objective was to utilize my expertise in machine
learning and artificial intelligence in order to develop and enhance algorithms and models for systems
characterized by randomness and uncertainty.



Throughout my PhD, I worked closely with my supervisors and fellow researchers, contributing to
the development of novel methods for analyzing complex stochastic systems. This collaborative
environment allowed me to deepen my understanding of machine learning and its applications,
ultimately resulting in the production of high-quality research and the advancement of the field.

Dr.words Project
Dec 2016 - Dec 2017 (1 year 1 month)
Dr. Words is the best mobile application awarded startup established in 2016 by me in Iran with a focus



on teaching the English language in an innovative way by the usage of games and attractive UI.
This mobile application was developed by Android SDK and SQLite in java.
It was planned to utilize NLP techniques to reorder the selected words to select a personalized teaching
methodology based on users' learning curves.

Junior Java Developer
Farsi WordNet Project
Nov 2011 - May 2012 (7 months)



Nov 2011 - May 2012 (7 months)
During my bachelor's, I was in the Farsi wordnet project as the senior Java developer.
WordNet is a lexical database for the English language. It groups words into sets of synonyms called
synsets, provides short definitions and usage examples, and records a number of relations among
these synonym sets or their members.
