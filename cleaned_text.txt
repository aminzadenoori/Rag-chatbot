MAIOR Driver Assignment is a web-based module, part of the MAIOR Operations suite, that manages traveling personnel of transportation companies or any personnel scheduled for predetermined activities or duties.

The system begins with work and rest scheduling of operators and allows you to handle various requests or changes in duties or assignments, up to final accounting of actual work done for correct employee payment.

The required data include operators' master data with all management attributes and the scheduled service on a calendar (runs, vehicle duties, driving duties, or duties to be covered).

The module uses complex optimization algorithms to optimize staff allocation to operators, enabling the pursuit of business objectives like equitable workload distribution or cost savings.

Uncovered duties can be manually or automatically assigned. All user operations are tracked and verified by the system, ensuring transparency and consistency with labor rules.

MAIOR Driver Assignment allows configuration of various constraints, such as limiting assignments to certain lines, working hours, maximum daily/weekly/monthly platform time, and minimum rest hours between consecutive working days.

Multiple labor contracts and personnel categorizations can be implemented simultaneously.

The software supports creating rotating rosters and ensures accurate resource management even with policy modifications and organizational changes.

All active constraints are checked in both automatic and manual assignments. The algorithm never violates the rules unless specifically instructed. Users are warned when an operation violates rules, but can proceed if the rule is not unbreakable. Violated rules can be listed, and who overrode them is tracked.

The module also processes operator requests made through the Driver Portal, such as absence requests or duty swaps between operators.

The system provides configurable KPIs to help users monitor their work and focus on pressing issues.

Overview

This page manages the assignment of duties and activities to operators. There's a toolbar with main commands on the left (see Roster toolbar commands). The roster displays operators as rows and dates as columns. Activities and duties assigned to an operator on a specific date are represented by rectangles.
